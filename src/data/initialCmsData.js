    content: `<h2>The Living Legacy of Zari & Zardosi</h2>
<p>Originating from the Persian words <em>Zar</em> (gold) and <em>Dozi</em> (embroidery), Zardosi is a centuries-old imperial craft that flourished under Mughal patronage in Lucknow, Varanasi, and Hyderabad. Unlike flat surface threadwork, authentic Zardosi is three-dimensional sculpture on fabric.</p>

<h3>How Karigars Stitch the Magic</h3>
<p>Artisans stretch pure silk, velvet, or organza tightly across a wooden frame called the <strong>Adda</strong>. Using a hooked needle (ari), they meticulously guide spangles (sitara), bullion coils (salma), seed pearls, and glass zarkans one by one into intricate peacock, floral, and sacred paisley motifs.</p>

<blockquote>"Each motif is not merely a design; it is hours of disciplined meditation by generational craftsmen preserving India's royal legacy."</blockquote>

<h3>Styling Zardosi Patches on Contemporary Wardrobes</h3>
<p>Today, DIY designers and boutique couriers use ready-made handcrafted Zardosi patches to transform plain georgette dupattas, velvet blouses, raw silk jackets, and festive potli bags into heirloom couture masterpieces without spending lakhs.</p>`

    content: `<h2>The Ancient Practice of Tamra Jal</h2>
<p>In classical Ayurvedic texts like the <em>Charaka Samhita</em>, storing clean water overnight in pure copper vessels (Tamra Patra) is prescribed as an essential daily habit known as <strong>Tamra Jal</strong>.</p>

<h3>Scientifically Proven Oligodynamic Effect</h3>
<p>Modern microbiological studies show that copper ions exert an oligodynamic effect, neutralizing harmful bacteria and microorganisms naturally within 8 to 12 hours of contact, rendering water revitalized and energetically balanced.</p>

<h3>How to Care for Your Hand-Hammered Copper Vessel</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Never store lemon juice, vinegar, or carbonated drinks in copper.</li>
  <li>Clean the interior weekly with natural tamarind pulp or salt and lemon.</li>
  <li>Wipe dry with a soft microfiber cloth to prevent water spots and preserve the copper luster.</li>
